## Getting started

### Dependencies

LAGraph currently depends on an installation of SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, but this is only temporary. Soon, LAGraph will simply depend on any GraphBLAS standard-compliant library.

### License

LAGraph is currently distributed under the BSD license. See the [LAGraph license here](https://github.com/GraphBLAS/LAGraph/blob/master/LICENSE).
