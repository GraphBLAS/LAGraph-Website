# LAGraph-Website

This repo is a Jekyll website hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Pages are created using a version of Markdown called [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html).

Right now, this is largely a proof-of-concept. It is not meant to be the official LAGraph website, but it may become that.

The initial focuses of this website are the following:

  * What is LAGraph?
    * What can LAGraph do?
    * Who uses LAGraph?
    * How does LAGraph relate to GraphBLAS?
  * LAGraph Getting Started
    * Download
    * Compilation

    * Algorithms
    * Utilities
  * LAGraph Language Binding Documentation
    * Python?
    * MATLAB?
    * R?
